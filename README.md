# Red Eclipse Framework

This repository contains all code used by Eclipse Technologies in the 2016 CARPA Initiative Challenge - The Lycanthrope Project. Failure in any aspect of the project is not in any way related to deficiencies in the code of this framework.

### The Robot

Although the final iteration of CAD files for the robot were lost, I managed to reconstruct and redesign the robot with more reasonable alignment and features. The CAD is very similar to the robot used on mission day, but is not identical. Materials are correctly defined but I probably made some parts too glossy. Various attachments and wires are not shown. The image is the result of 2,000 rendering iterations.

- Video stream
- Object tracking and motion detection
- Object learning and recognition
- Single camera SLAM (external processing)
- Audio feed and pitch recogintion
- Voice control
- Fully rotatable head
- RFID scanning
- Fine leg motion (pushing buttons)
- Basic "follow" capacity (not well-tested)
